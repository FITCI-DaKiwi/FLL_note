## About FITCI DaKiwi

Team DaKiwi, a dynamic and innovative Lego League robotic team comprising six 10-11 years old school children. These young minds are bursting with enthusiasm, creativity, and a shared passion for building, creating, and making a positive impact on their local community.

At DaKiwi, we believe in nurturing the innate curiosity and potential of each child. Our mission is to provide a platform where these young engineers can explore, experiment, and learn in a supportive and fun environment. With Lego bricks as their tools, they embark on exciting adventures of discovery, problem-solving, and teamwork.
